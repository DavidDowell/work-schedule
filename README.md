# work-day-scheduler

* This project was to create a schedule that dynamically changes color formats and logs user information in local storage.
* Timeblocks were created for a normal 9-5 job and the color changes according to the current time of day, allowing the user to have an idea of what needs to be prioritized on the schedule and what is coming up.
* Inside of these color-coded timeblocks are input fields for the user to set important tasks that can be saved locally.


* Create a work day schedule to prioritize events and times
* GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
* WHEN I open the planner
* THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
* WHEN I scroll down
* THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
* WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
* THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
* WHEN I click into a timeblock
* THEN I can enter an event
* WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
* THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
* WHEN I refresh the page
* THEN the saved events persist
